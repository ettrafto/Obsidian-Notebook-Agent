# Cursor Bridge (stub)

## Allowed
- Write new notes into `/inbox/` and `/projects/`
- Append to existing notes when explicitly commanded
- Propose refactors as PR-style diffs

## Disallowed

- No rewriting project plans
- No mass edits without review

## Command Style
- Prefer explicit verbs: "capture:", "append:", "create project:"
