# Vault Index (Generated)

## Purpose
This index provides a stable map of Atlas vault structure and key reference files. Regenerate it when structure changes or during weekly maintenance.

## Key Maps
### Architecture
- `vault/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `vault/architecture/DECISIONS.md`
- `vault/architecture/decisions/`

### Planning
- `vault/planning/now.md`
- `vault/planning/masterplan.md`
- `vault/planning/progress.md`

### Contracts
- `vault/contracts/VAULT_CONTRACT.md`
- `vault/contracts/API_CONTRACT.md`
- `vault/contracts/GIT_CONTRACT.md`

### Tasks
- `vault/tasks/tasks.md`
- `vault/tasks/tasks-summary.md` (if it exists)

### System
- `vault/system/weekly-report.md`
- `vault/system/maintenance.md`
- `vault/system/architecture-diff.md`
- `vault/system/cursor-bridge.md`
